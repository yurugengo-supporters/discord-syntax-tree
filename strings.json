{"helpMessage": "Hello, I'm a bot that creates syntax trees. I may have more functions in the future. In the meantime, you can call me with the `/tree` command, followed by the correct bracket notation of a syntax tree. I'm based Andr√© Eisenbach's jsSyntaxTree, so if you need help figuring out how to build a tree, check his website at https://www.ironcreek.net/syntaxtree/."}
